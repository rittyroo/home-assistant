# Updates
- Moved to using an InfluxDB instance to keep historic data and display time-series sensor data.
- Switched from using the Synology to a Pi4/4GB and HassIO.  The separation of services is preferred.
- The HISTORY and RECORDER component seem to be hit or miss.  They are configured but not working properly - I need to figure out why.
- Upgraded container to 0.94.3
- Updated repo to include all of my directories and components/custom cards.  Some things are still a work-in-progress, but everything is now here and updated.  My previous config (pre major change) is still here but renamed with .old.
